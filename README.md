## Description
`PetTrax` is a Full-Stack web application conceived and executed collaboratively using agile methodologies and project management tools to build a pet tracker app that runs in a web browser and is accessible from any computer or mobile device. `Petrax` has a responsive design and intuitive UI that is simple to use and easily accessible on smaller screens.

This application follows the `Model-View-Controller` Paradigm and ultilizes back-end development principles and technologies for the UI design and functionality. `MySQL` was used to store data related to a user's pet that is compiled into a daily log, which can be viewed, monitored, or shared with other users. The accruacy of the log is dependent on user input for three specific events: pee, poo, food. The date & time of each event is stored within the applicaion and accessible for multiple user-sessions. 

`Node.js` and `Express.js` create a RESTful API with GET and POST routes called for retrieving and adding new event data. A `Sequelize` ORM protects API Keys (Object-Relational Mapping) and sensitive information with environment variables. This application is hosted and deployed on `Heroku: Cloud Application Platform` .
