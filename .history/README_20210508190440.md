```md

SO THAT I can keep an accurate log of certain events 
WHICH I can share with a vet in case of emergency 
AND manage my pets health and wellness. 


```

## Description <img src="assets/icons8-dog_tag.png">

This application follows the `Model-View-Controller` paradigm and ultilizes back-end technologies and front-end frameworks for the UI design and functionality. `MySQL` was used to store user data that is compiled into a daily log, which can be viewed, monitored, or shared with other users. The accruacy of the log is dependent on user input for three specific events:  <img src="public/img/icons/Pee-icon.png" width="38" height="30"> , <img src="public/img/icons/Poo-icon.png" width="40" height="30"> , <img src="public/img/icons/Food-icon.png" width="40" height="20">  The date & time of each event is stored within the applicaion and accessible for multiple user-sessions. 

`Node.js` and `Express.js` create a RESTful API with GET and POST routes called for retrieving and adding new event data. A `Sequelize` ORM protects API Keys (Object-Relational Mapping) and sensitive information with environment variables. `Cloudinary's` Javascript SDK provides addtional functionality for uploading images upload featur- This application is hosted and deployed on `Heroku: Cloud Application Platform` .
